for running the jquery we must have to import the jquery API's
using the src attribute of the script tag
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js">
</script>
It is compulsory for running the jquery in script file

$(document).ready(function() {
	//code to be write here
});
is these way we have define the self executing function
when we have to run the jquery in javascript
